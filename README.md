# Portfolio

## Description
    This portfolio was created to practice and exhibit the skills learned from HTML and CSS. Aside from showing my understanding with the material, creating a portfolio is one of the first steps to becoming a software developer. With the beginnings of this portfolio, I will be able to give a brief description of myself and exhibit my best works to fellow developers and potential employers.
    There were several problems that I have stumbled across in creating this project, including: correctly orienting flex boxes, properly structuring the body, giving nice stylist properties to the page, working with background images, and working with anchor tag references. Majority of the problems came from implementing media queries into my portfolio. With this, I had to essectially redesign the page with smaller media queries.

    After building this portfolio, I have learned how to properly build a webpage using HTML and CSS. HTML was used to build the foundation of the webpage, giving the proper semantic elements, and outlining each section for styling. The HTML was also used to reference local links within the page, links for my "works", and links on how to contact me. CSS was used to style the HTML elements. With CSS, I was able to style my "works" section using background photos and pseudo-classes. When working with media queries, I have learned that using percentages and relative values was much more easier than absolute sizes. This made it easier to adjust the layout within different media queries. For example, by giving each work-card width a percentage of its given container, I did not have to worry so much about the card's size and only focused on the orientation of the container.

    This project was the first step into understanding how to use HTML and CSS.

## Usage
    To use the Porfolio, follow the link into the webpage. There are local links in the header to help navigate you to different sections of the portfolio. Within the "Work" section, each card is provided with a link that will redirect you. Although I do not currently have any projects created under me, I have linked different sites based off of the background picture. In the footer, there are links on how to contact me.
